geninit - a modular initramfs creation utility

it's fast.
it's flexible.
it's familiar.
it's clean and hackable.
it might even do your dishes...


Building a standard kernel image preset...
# time geninit -p kernel26
:: Building image from preset: kernel26-default
  ==> -k 2.6.38-ARCH -c /etc/geninit.conf -g /boot/initramfs-ARCH 
:: Building: [base]

And building a pair of lighter images for my custom kernel...
# time geninit -p kernel26-rampage
:: Building image from preset: kernel26-rampage-default
 ==> -k 2.6.38.4-rampage -c /etc/geninit.conf -g /boot/initramfs-rampage
