  This hook causes the init process to interrupt
  for a fixed time interval. The time in seconds
  can be specified in the sleeptime= command line
  parameter. The default is 5 seconds.
  If a sleepdevice= parameter is specified, sleep
  until the given device node is available, polling
  at one second intervals until sleeptime is reached.
